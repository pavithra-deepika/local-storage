## Learnt
 - LocalStorage is a web storage object that allows JavaScript sites and apps to keep key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date.
 - In basic terms, local storage enables developers to store and retrieve data in the browser.
 - ## How to Implement localStorage in React
    - setItem(): This method is used to add a key and a value to localStorage.
    - getItem(): This method is used to get an item from localStorage using the key.
    - removeItem(): This technique is used to delete an item from localStorage based on its key.
    - clear(): This technique is used to delete all instances of localStorage.
    - key(): When you supply a number, it aids in the retrieval of a localStorage key. 
  - create Login page and dashboard page.
  - First step in this project login page using two input value and submit button using form method.
  - I have used one  hook - usestate() and useNavigate().
  - useState() â€“ The state of your application is guaranteed to change at some time. The useState() hook is a function that accepts one parameter, the initial state (which might be the value of a variable, an object, or any other sort of data in your component), and returns two values: the current state and a function that can be used to update the state.
  - the useNavigate hook to get the navigate function. Defines the function handleChange that checks whether the user has entered the correct user login and password; if so, then the navigate function is invoked with the /dashboard path to route the user to the dashboard Page. navigate("/dashboard"). display the output page welcome to user.
